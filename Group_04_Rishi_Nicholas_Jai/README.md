## 1. Authorized Research Title & Problem Statement

> "How can a multi-arm robotic gripper mechanism simulated in MuJoCo utilize impedance contact control to synchronize with and capture tumbling non-cooperative orbital debris in LEO while mitigating collision impulse and momentum transfer?"

### Core Engineering Focus
* **Physics & Kinematics:** Google DeepMind MuJoCo multi-body dynamic physics simulation (`models/space_debris_gripper.xml`).
* **Autonomous Control:** Closed-loop Python control architecture with student implementation boundaries (`src/debris_capture_controller.py`).
* **Technoeconomic Evaluation:** Dimensionless CSBS operational economics, cost per operation, and return on investment model (`analytics/constellation_economics.py`).
* **Empirical Validation:** Reproducible benchmark trials across 60 paired Monte Carlo runs and statistical hypothesis testing (`analytics/real_trials_summary.csv`, `analytics/impedance_real_trials.csv`, and `analytics/rigid_pd_real_trials.csv`).

> [!NOTE]
> ### The Devil's Advocate: Reality Check & Theoretical Roast
> *"Modeling viscoelastic impedance contact control in microgravity, where your biggest mathematical triumph will be transferring just enough rotational impulse during capture to convert a dead 2-ton Soviet booster into an unstoppable 10,000 RPM orbital buzzsaw."*

## 5. Pedagogical Boundaries: Guidance vs Student Ownership

To ensure academic rigor and authentic student learning, this repository enforces strict boundaries between scaffolding and student deliverables:

* **Provided by Course Scaffolding:**
  * Validated physical model architecture in MuJoCo MJCF (`models/space_debris_gripper.xml`).
  * Verification toolchain and smoke test script (`src/test_env.py`).
  * Literature foundation, mathematical formulations, and conference paper blueprint (`docs/`).
  * Dimensionless technoeconomic framework (`analytics/constellation_economics.py`).
* **Student Technical Deliverables (Required for Evaluation):**
  * Implement and tune the control algorithm in `src/debris_capture_controller.py` (filling all marked `# TODO [Student Roll / Name]` blocks).
  * Run physics simulation trials to collect and expand empirical data in `analytics/real_trials_summary.csv` (`impedance_real_trials.csv` and `rigid_pd_real_trials.csv`).
  * Re-run `analytics/generate_paper_figures.py` to regenerate publication figures with live experimental telemetry.
  * Author the final 4-page IEEE conference paper in `docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_MANUSCRIPT_BLUEPRINT.md` and defend individual Git commits during the oral viva.
