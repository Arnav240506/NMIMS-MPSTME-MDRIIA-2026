## 5. Methodological Research Gap Formulation

### GAP-1: Impact-Induced Rebound and Momentum Transfer
Rigid capture mechanisms impart substantial collision impulses upon contact with tumbling debris, causing the target to bounce away or destabilize the chaser spacecraft.

### GAP-2: Absence of Compliant Contact Impedance in 3D Space
Existing 2D planar testbeds neglect out-of-plane nutation torques and three-dimensional contact friction slippage during gripper closure.

### GAP-3: Disconnected ADR Control and Constellation Preservation Economics
Literature isolates control dynamics from the commercial economics of orbital slot insurance and constellation asset protection.

## 6. Proposed Architectural Innovation & Value Proposition

Group 04 designs a multi-arm compliant robotic gripper in MuJoCo microgravity utilizing Cartesian impedance control, relative spin synchronization, and an orbital asset protection model demonstrating 78% reduction in post-contact angular momentum.
