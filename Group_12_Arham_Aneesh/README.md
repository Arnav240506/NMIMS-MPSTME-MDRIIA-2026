## 1. Authorized Research Title & Problem Statement

> "To what extent can an autonomous aerial drone simulated in MuJoCo with optical and thermal vision optimize defect localization latency and structural coverage for industrial pipeline surveillance compared to manual ground inspection?"

### Core Engineering Focus
* **Physics & Kinematics:** Google DeepMind MuJoCo multi-body dynamic physics simulation (`models/pipeline_surveillance_drone.xml`).
* **Autonomous Control:** Closed-loop Python control architecture with student implementation boundaries (`src/drone_pipeline_controller.py`).
* **Technoeconomic Evaluation:** Dimensionless CSBS operational economics and return on investment model (`analytics/pipeline_monitoring_roi.py`).
* **Empirical Validation:** Reproducible benchmark trials and statistical hypothesis testing (`analytics/pipeline_inspection_real_trials.csv`).

> [!NOTE]
> ### The Devil's Advocate: Reality Check & Theoretical Roast
> *"Deploying an autonomous aerial drone with optical and thermal vision to inspect remote oil and gas pipelines, blithely assuming that thermal plumes won't toss your quadrotor into high-pressure flare stacks, GPS multipath won't send you careening into flange valves, and pipeline acoustic noise won't deafen your onboard telemetry."*
