## 5. Methodological Research Gap Formulation

### GAP-1: Coupled Slosh-Aware Kinematics in Cluttered Hospital Corridors
Existing hospital AMRs either prioritize velocity or implement static safety margins, leading to vial tipping or liquid spillage when abruptly evading erratic pedestrians.

### GAP-2: Absence of Closed-Loop Time-Motion Clinical Economics
Robotics literature focuses purely on path planning, whereas healthcare management journals document nursing fatigue without unifying robotic dispatch latency with clinical labor reallocation.

### GAP-3: Rigid-Body Assumption in Dynamic Simulation
Simulations typically model AMRs as simple kinematic points or rigid boxes, ignoring payload compartment inertial shifts and wheel slip across disinfected hospital vinyl floors.

Group 01 implements a 3D multi-body MuJoCo simulation of a differential-drive AMR with anti-slosh acceleration damping, four-quadrant DWA trajectory planning, and a closed-loop CSBS clinical workflow model demonstrating over 65% reduction in nurse logistics transit time.
