## 1. Authorized Research Title & Problem Statement

> "To what extent can an autonomous mobile medicine-delivery robot (simulated in MuJoCo with dynamic obstacle avoidance) reduce ICU nurses' non-patient-facing logistics transit time and optimize labor reallocation, where clinical studies document nurses spending approximately 28% of their shift on supply retrieval?"

### Core Engineering Focus
* **Physics & Kinematics:** Google DeepMind MuJoCo multi-body dynamic physics simulation (`models/icu_medicine_amr.xml`).
* **Autonomous Control:** Closed-loop Python control architecture with student implementation boundaries (`src/icu_amr_controller.py`).
* **Technoeconomic Evaluation:** Dimensionless CSBS operational economics and return on investment model (`analytics/icu_labor_roi.py`).
* **Empirical Validation:** Reproducible benchmark trials and statistical hypothesis testing (`analytics/icu_medicine_delivery_real_trials.csv`).

> [!NOTE]
> ### The Devil's Advocate: Reality Check & Theoretical Roast
> *"A pristine DeepMind MuJoCo simulation naively assuming that busy ICU nurses won't leave metal IV drip poles scattered across the corridor, won't smash the emergency stop button because 'it made a weird beep', and that 500 mL saline bags obey Newtonian mechanics without sloshing all over your LiDAR optics."*

## 5. Pedagogical Boundaries: Guidance vs Student Ownership

To ensure academic rigor and authentic student learning, this repository enforces strict boundaries between scaffolding and student deliverables:

* **Provided by Course Scaffolding:**
  * Validated physical model architecture in MuJoCo MJCF (`models/icu_medicine_amr.xml`).
  * Verification toolchain and smoke test script (`src/test_env.py`).
  * Literature foundation, mathematical formulations, and conference paper blueprint (`docs/`).
  * Dimensionless technoeconomic framework (`analytics/icu_labor_roi.py`).
* **Student Technical Deliverables (Required for Evaluation):**
  * Implement and tune the control algorithm in `src/icu_amr_controller.py` (filling all marked `# TODO [Student Roll / Name]` blocks).
  * Run physics simulation trials to collect and expand empirical data in `analytics/icu_medicine_delivery_real_trials.csv`.
  * Re-run `analytics/generate_paper_figures.py` to regenerate publication figures with live experimental telemetry.
  * Author the final 4-page IEEE conference paper in `docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_MANUSCRIPT_BLUEPRINT.md` and defend individual Git commits during the oral viva.
