## 5. Methodological Research Gap Formulation

### GAP-1: Perimeter Blind Spots in Foot Patrols
Manual security foot patrols require 45 to 60 minutes per cycle, creating extensive unmonitored temporal windows easily exploited by unauthorized intruders.

### GAP-2: Lack of Multi-UAV Coordinated Search and Triage
Standard commercial drones operate as isolated units without automated target handoff between a high-altitude scout and a low-altitude interceptor.

### GAP-3: Absence of Physical Flight Constraints in Patrol Theory
Perimeter patrol literature models agents as virtual geometric points, neglecting battery discharge dynamics, rotor wind resistance, and camera pitch limits.
