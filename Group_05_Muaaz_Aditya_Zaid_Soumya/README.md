## 1. Authorized Research Title & Problem Statement

> "To what extent can a collaborative dual-UAV surveillance system simulated in MuJoCo optimize campus perimeter patrol cycle time and OpenCV human detection latency compared to static security guard patrols?"

### Core Engineering Focus
* **Physics & Kinematics:** Google DeepMind MuJoCo multi-body dynamic physics simulation (`models/campus_perimeter_patrol.xml`).
* **Autonomous Control:** Closed-loop Python control architecture with student implementation boundaries (`src/aerial_patrol_swarm.py`).
* **Technoeconomic Evaluation:** Dimensionless CSBS operational economics and return on investment model (`analytics/campus_security_economics.py`).
* **Empirical Validation:** Reproducible benchmark trials and statistical hypothesis testing (`analytics/campus_patrol_real_trials.csv`).

> [!NOTE]
> ### The Devil's Advocate: Reality Check & Theoretical Roast
> *"Architecting a cooperative multi-agent aerial consensus protocol to detect campus perimeter breaches, completely ignoring that 15-knot coastal sea breezes, campus WiFi dead zones, and a flock of territorial pigeons will immediately turn your decentralized swarm consensus into a synchronized double-tree landing."*

## 5. Pedagogical Boundaries: Guidance vs Student Ownership

To ensure academic rigor and authentic student learning, this repository enforces strict boundaries between scaffolding and student deliverables:

* **Provided by Course Scaffolding:**
  * Validated physical model architecture in MuJoCo MJCF (`models/campus_perimeter_patrol.xml`).
  * Verification toolchain and smoke test script (`src/test_env.py`).
  * Literature foundation, mathematical formulations, and conference paper blueprint (`docs/`).
  * Dimensionless technoeconomic framework (`analytics/campus_security_economics.py`).
* **Student Technical Deliverables (Required for Evaluation):**
  * Implement and tune the control algorithm in `src/aerial_patrol_swarm.py` (filling all marked `# TODO [Student Roll / Name]` blocks).
  * Run physics simulation trials to collect and expand empirical data in `analytics/campus_patrol_real_trials.csv`.
  * Re-run `analytics/generate_paper_figures.py` to regenerate publication figures with live experimental telemetry.
  * Author the final 4-page IEEE conference paper in `docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_MANUSCRIPT_BLUEPRINT.md` and defend individual Git commits during the oral viva.

## 6. Sprint 0 Onboarding & Physics Environment Verification

Verify your local Python and MuJoCo simulation environment:

```powershell
# Step 1: Clone repository and navigate to group directory
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_root>/Group_05_Muaaz_Aditya_Zaid_Soumya
