## 1. Authorized Research Title & Problem Statement

> "How can autonomous mobile-robot navigation and sensor-based anomaly detection improve the speed and accuracy of locating defective solar panels in large-scale solar installations compared with manual inspection?"

### Core Engineering Focus
* **Physics & Kinematics:** Google DeepMind MuJoCo multi-body dynamic physics simulation (`models/solar_defect_amr.xml`).
* **Autonomous Control:** Closed-loop Python control architecture with student implementation boundaries (`src/solar_defect_detector.py`).
* **Technoeconomic Evaluation:** Dimensionless CSBS operational economics and return on investment model (`analytics/solar_pv_roi.py`).
* **Empirical Validation:** Reproducible benchmark trials and statistical hypothesis testing (`analytics/solar_inspection_real_trials.csv`).

> [!NOTE]
> ### The Devil's Advocate: Reality Check & Theoretical Roast
> *"Simulating an autonomous ground rover with multimodal sensor arrays to inspect vast photovoltaic farms, naively assuming that high-intensity ground heat shimmer won't blind your thermal camera, blowing sand won't jam your steering linkages, and desert dust won't bake onto your solar panels faster than you can detect it."*
