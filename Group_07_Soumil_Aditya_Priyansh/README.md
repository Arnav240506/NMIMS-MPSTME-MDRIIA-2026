## 1. Authorized Research Title & Problem Statement

> "How can an autonomous mobile manipulator simulated in MuJoCo for clutter classification and grasp planning reduce daily patient-room turnaround time for hospital housekeeping staff from the baseline 10-20 minutes per room?"

### Core Engineering Focus
* **Physics & Kinematics:** Google DeepMind MuJoCo multi-body dynamic physics simulation (`models/hospital_clutter_manipulator.xml`).
* **Autonomous Control:** Closed-loop Python control architecture with student implementation boundaries (`src/clutter_manipulator_controller.py`).
* **Technoeconomic Evaluation:** Dimensionless CSBS operational economics and return on investment model (`analytics/nosocomial_turnover_economics.py`).
* **Empirical Validation:** Reproducible benchmark trials and statistical hypothesis testing (`analytics/clutter_manipulation_real_trials.csv`).

> [!NOTE]
> ### The Devil's Advocate: Reality Check & Theoretical Roast
> *"Training a mobile manipulator with a 6-DOF articulated arm to classify and declutter post-operative recovery rooms, whose neural network will inevitably classify a patient's unlabelled prescription spectacles as biohazard waste and deposit them into the recycling bin with sub-millimeter precision."*

## 5. Pedagogical Boundaries: Guidance vs Student Ownership

To ensure academic rigor and authentic student learning, this repository enforces strict boundaries between scaffolding and student deliverables:

* **Provided by Course Scaffolding:**
  * Validated physical model architecture in MuJoCo MJCF (`models/hospital_clutter_manipulator.xml`).
  * Verification toolchain and smoke test script (`src/test_env.py`).
  * Literature foundation, mathematical formulations, and conference paper blueprint (`docs/`).
  * Dimensionless technoeconomic framework (`analytics/nosocomial_turnover_economics.py`).
* **Student Technical Deliverables (Required for Evaluation):**
  * Implement and tune the control algorithm in `src/clutter_manipulator_controller.py` (filling all marked `# TODO [Student Roll / Name]` blocks).
  * Run physics simulation trials to collect and expand empirical data in `analytics/clutter_manipulation_real_trials.csv`.
  * Re-run `analytics/generate_paper_figures.py` to regenerate publication figures with live experimental telemetry.
  * Author the final 4-page IEEE conference paper in `docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_MANUSCRIPT_BLUEPRINT.md` and defend individual Git commits during the oral viva.
