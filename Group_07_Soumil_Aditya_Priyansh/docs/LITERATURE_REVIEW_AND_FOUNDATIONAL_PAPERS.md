## 5. Methodological Research Gap Formulation

### GAP-1: Hospital Room Turnaround Delay (10-20 min)
Housekeeping staff spend 10 to 20 minutes manually picking up dropped items and bedside debris, delaying bed availability for incoming critical patients.

### GAP-2: High Risk of Knocking Over Fragile Instruments
Standard robotic arms plan straight-line trajectories that inadvertently topple adjacent IV drip bottles or sterile equipment when attempting to grab bedside clutter.

### GAP-3: Disconnect Between Manipulation Success and Turnaround ROI
Robotic grasping papers report grasp success rates without measuring operational labor savings or hospital bed turnover economics.
