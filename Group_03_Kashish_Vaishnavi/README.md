## 1. Authorized Research Title & Problem Statement

> "Can an autonomous last-mile ground AED delivery vehicle simulated in MuJoCo reduce time-to-first-shock below urban ambulance congestion delays (15-20 minutes), given that sudden cardiac arrest survival drops 7-10% for every minute without defibrillation?"

### Core Engineering Focus
* **Physics & Kinematics:** Google DeepMind MuJoCo multi-body dynamic physics simulation (`models/aed_delivery_amr.xml`).
* **Autonomous Control:** Closed-loop Python control architecture with student implementation boundaries (`src/aed_navigation_controller.py`).
* **Technoeconomic Evaluation:** Dimensionless CSBS operational economics and return on investment model (`analytics/cardiac_survival_economics.py`).
* **Empirical Validation:** Reproducible benchmark trials and statistical hypothesis testing (`analytics/aed_delivery_real_trials.csv`).

> [!NOTE]
> ### The Devil's Advocate: Reality Check & Theoretical Roast
> *"Engineering a 4-wheel independent suspension chassis to outrun sudden cardiac arrest across urban traffic, assuming Indian municipal sidewalks don't feature open storm drains, sudden pavement trenches, and stray dogs who consider your shockproof defibrillator pod their new favorite chew toy."*

## 5. Pedagogical Boundaries: Guidance vs Student Ownership

To ensure academic rigor and authentic student learning, this repository enforces strict boundaries between scaffolding and student deliverables:

* **Provided by Course Scaffolding:**
  * Validated physical model architecture in MuJoCo MJCF (`models/aed_delivery_amr.xml`).
  * Verification toolchain and smoke test script (`src/test_env.py`).
  * Literature foundation, mathematical formulations, and conference paper blueprint (`docs/`).
  * Dimensionless technoeconomic framework (`analytics/cardiac_survival_economics.py`).
* **Student Technical Deliverables (Required for Evaluation):**
  * Implement and tune the control algorithm in `src/aed_navigation_controller.py` (filling all marked `# TODO [Student Roll / Name]` blocks).
  * Run physics simulation trials to collect and expand empirical data in `analytics/aed_delivery_real_trials.csv`.
  * Re-run `analytics/generate_paper_figures.py` to regenerate publication figures with live experimental telemetry.
  * Author the final 4-page IEEE conference paper in `docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_MANUSCRIPT_BLUEPRINT.md` and defend individual Git commits during the oral viva.
