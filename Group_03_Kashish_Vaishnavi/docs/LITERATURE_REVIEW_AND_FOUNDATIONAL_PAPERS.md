## 5. Methodological Research Gap Formulation

### GAP-1: Ambulance Gridlock in High-Density Urban Cores
Conventional road ambulances cannot bypass traffic jams, routinely taking 15 to 20 minutes, while AED delivery drones are grounded during adverse weather.

### GAP-2: Sidewalk Terrain and Curb Traversability at Speed
Standard delivery rovers crawl at 1.0 m/s and cannot traverse sidewalk curbs (10-15 cm) without tipping or damaging sensitive medical electronics.

### GAP-3: Absence of Dynamic Resuscitation Latency Budgeting
Existing logistics planners optimize total distance rather than dynamically budgeting transit speed against physiological cardiac arrest survival decay curves.

## 6. Proposed Architectural Innovation & Value Proposition

Group 03 implements a high-mobility 4-wheel drive ground robot in MuJoCo with independent suspension, curb-climbing dynamics, dynamic sidewalk obstacle evasion at 3.5 m/s, and a physiological survival optimization controller achieving time-to-first-shock under 4.5 minutes.
