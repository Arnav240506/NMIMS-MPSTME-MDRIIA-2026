## 5. Methodological Research Gap Formulation

### GAP-1: Submerged Ground Access in Flood Calamities
NDRF ground rescue boats require 2 to 4 hours to navigate floodwaters, tree debris, and submerged electrical lines to reach marooned survivors.

### GAP-2: Payload Swing Instability Under Turbulent Crosswinds
Undamped cable-suspended relief packages act as chaotic pendulums under storm gusts, degrading air-drop targeting accuracy and causing vehicle roll instabilities.

### GAP-3: Absence of Payload-Range-Cost Optimization in Relief Fleets
Existing drone trials operate one-off flights without a rigorous technoeconomic model balancing battery payload mass limits against rescue mission fleet amortization.
