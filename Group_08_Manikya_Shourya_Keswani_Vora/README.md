## 5. Pedagogical Boundaries: Guidance vs Student Ownership

To ensure academic rigor and authentic student learning, this repository enforces strict boundaries between scaffolding and student deliverables:

* **Provided by Course Scaffolding:**
  * Validated physical model architecture in MuJoCo MJCF (`models/skyhydro_flood_uav.xml`).
  * Verification toolchain and smoke test script (`src/test_env.py`).
  * Literature foundation, mathematical formulations, and conference paper blueprint (`docs/`).
  * Dimensionless technoeconomic framework (`analytics/disaster_relief_logistics.py`).
* **Student Technical Deliverables (Required for Evaluation):**
  * Implement and tune the control algorithm in `src/flood_relief_drop_sim.py` (filling all marked `# TODO [Student Roll / Name]` blocks).
  * Run physics simulation trials to collect and expand empirical data in `analytics/flood_relief_real_trials.csv`.
  * Re-run `analytics/generate_paper_figures.py` to regenerate publication figures with live experimental telemetry.
  * Author the final 4-page IEEE conference paper in `docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_MANUSCRIPT_BLUEPRINT.md` and defend individual Git commits during the oral viva.

## 6. Sprint 0 Onboarding & Physics Environment Verification

Verify your local Python and MuJoCo simulation environment:

```powershell
# Step 1: Clone repository and navigate to group directory
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_root>/Group_08_Manikya_Shourya_Keswani_Vora

# Step 2: Checkout your individual feature branch
# Example for lead student:
git checkout -b feat/e056-lead-uav-aerodynamic

# Step 3: Run environment smoke test
python src/test_env.py

# Step 4: Verify 300 DPI publication figures
python analytics/generate_paper_figures.py
