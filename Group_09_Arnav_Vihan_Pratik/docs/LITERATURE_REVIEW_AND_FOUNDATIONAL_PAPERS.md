## 5. Methodological Research Gap Formulation

### GAP-1: Severe Teleoperation Latency and Video Link Degradation
Manual remote piloting of rescue robots fails in collapsed concrete environments due to multi-second video lag, resulting in robot rollover or immobilization.

### GAP-2: Wheel Slip on Unstructured Rubble and Gravel
Planar differential drive models assume pure rolling without slipping, causing catastrophic odometry drift on steep 25-degree rubble slopes.

### GAP-3: Absence of Autonomous 2.5D Elevation Cost-Mapping
Commercial inspection rovers lack onboard real-time elevation profiling to autonomously reject untraversable chasms without human intervention.

## 6. Proposed Architectural Innovation & Value Proposition

Group 09 implements a 4-wheel skid-steer UGV in MuJoCo featuring realistic ground contact friction, simulated multi-ray LiDAR elevation cost-mapping, autonomous waypoint traversal over rubble, and an operator workload reduction of over 60%.
