**Course:** Modern Day Robotics and Its Industrial Applications (MDRIIA - Course Code: 702CO0E012)  
**Academic Term:** Academic Year 2026–2027 | Semester VI (B.Tech CSBS)  
**Institution:** SVKM's NMIMS MPSTME, Mumbai

## 1. Authorized Research Title & Problem Statement

> "How can an autonomous crawler cleaning robot simulated in MuJoCo recover soiling-induced energy losses (15-18% monthly) on inclined commercial rooftop solar arrays while reducing cleaning cycle operational expenditure compared to manual labor?"

### Core Engineering Focus
* **Physics & Kinematics:** Google DeepMind MuJoCo multi-body dynamic physics simulation (`models/solar_cleaning_crawler.xml`).
* **Autonomous Control:** Closed-loop Python control architecture with student implementation boundaries (`src/crawler_cleaning_controller.py`).
* **Technoeconomic Evaluation:** Dimensionless CSBS operational economics and return on investment model (`analytics/photovoltaic_degradation_economics.py`).
* **Empirical Validation:** Reproducible benchmark trials and statistical hypothesis testing (`analytics/solar_cleaning_real_trials.csv`).

---

> [!NOTE]
> ### The Devil's Advocate: Reality Check & Theoretical Roast
> *"Engineering a tracked dry-cleaning crawler that eliminates 95% of soiling loss on utility-scale solar arrays, provided the panels are tilted at perfect lab angles and never encounter dried bird droppings that have baked under 44°C Mumbai sunlight into industrial-grade ceramic glaze."*

## 5. Pedagogical Boundaries: Guidance vs Student Ownership

To ensure academic rigor and authentic student learning, this repository enforces strict boundaries between scaffolding and student deliverables:

* **Provided by Course Scaffolding:**
  * Validated physical model architecture in MuJoCo MJCF (`models/solar_cleaning_crawler.xml`).
  * Verification toolchain and smoke test script (`src/test_env.py`).
  * Literature foundation, mathematical formulations, and conference paper blueprint (`docs/`).
  * Dimensionless technoeconomic framework (`analytics/photovoltaic_degradation_economics.py`).
* **Student Technical Deliverables (Required for Evaluation):**
  * Implement and tune the control algorithm in `src/crawler_cleaning_controller.py` (filling all marked `# TODO [Student Roll / Name]` blocks).
  * Run physics simulation trials to collect and expand empirical data in `analytics/solar_cleaning_real_trials.csv`.
  * Re-run `analytics/generate_paper_figures.py` to regenerate publication figures with live experimental telemetry.
  * Author the final 4-page IEEE conference paper in `docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_MANUSCRIPT_BLUEPRINT.md` and defend individual Git commits during the oral viva.
