## 5. Methodological Research Gap Formulation

### GAP-1: Severe Monthly Soiling Degradation (15-18%)
Atmospheric dust and urban smog degrade commercial rooftop PV generation by up to 18% monthly, while manual cleaning is dangerous, irregular, and water-intensive.

### GAP-2: Crawler Slippage on Steep Inclines (15-35 deg)
Standard wheeled or tracked rovers suffer loss of traction on smooth, inclined PV glass, causing panel damage or structural falls during high-speed traversal.

### GAP-3: Absence of Closed-Loop Soiling-to-LCOE Optimization
Prior work treats mechanical cleaning and economic LCOE modeling independently, lacking a unified framework to trigger cleaning cycles based on real-time irradiance value.

Group 06 designs an autonomous tracked climbing robot in MuJoCo with polyurethane high-friction treads, balanced downforce contact physics, a waterless rotary microfiber cleaning mechanism, and a CSBS LCOE optimization engine recovering over 92% of lost solar yield.
