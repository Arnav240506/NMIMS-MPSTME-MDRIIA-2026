## 5. Methodological Research Gap Formulation

### GAP-1: Physiological Tremor Exceeds Microsurgical Limits
Inherent human hand tremor (8-12 Hz, amplitude 50-100 um) exceeds the precision thresholds required for delicate microsurgery (retinal vein cannulation, neurosurgery).

### GAP-2: Kinematic Singularities in 7-DOF Redundant Arms
Standard inverse kinematics algorithms produce infinite joint velocities near kinematic singularities, threatening catastrophic tissue tearing during surgery.

### GAP-3: Filtering Phase Lag in Real-Time Surgical Teleoperation
Excessive filtering introduces latency (> 50 ms) that causes surgeon perceptual disorientation and unstable hand-eye coordination.
