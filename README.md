## Student Cohort Commendation & Acknowledgments

SVKM's NMIMS MPSTME conveys its highest commendation, sincere appreciation, and heartfelt gratitude to all thirty-three (33) student researchers across the twelve specialized engineering project teams of Semester VI (Academic Year 2026–2027).

Through disciplined commitment to the Aalborg-UNESCO Problem-Based Learning framework, each engineering team tackled genuine open technical and industrial challenges spanning autonomous ICU medicine transport, vision-guided elderly fall response, rapid emergency defibrillator transit, non-cooperative orbital space debris capture, cooperative dual-UAV campus perimeter surveillance, autonomous solar panel soiling remediation, intelligent hospital room decluttering, vision-guided flood relief delivery, hazardous terrain exploration, and tremor-suppressed sub-millimeter surgical manipulation. Your hard work in deriving rigid-body kinematic hierarchies in DeepMind MuJoCo, developing closed-loop PID and state-machine controllers, capturing high-frequency empirical telemetry datasets, and formulating rigorous Computer Science and Business Systems (CSBS) technoeconomic models sets an exemplary benchmark for undergraduate research and engineering craftsmanship.

> *"Scientists discover the world that exists; engineers create the world that never was."*  
> — **Theodore von Kármán**

> *"There is no substitute for hard work. Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration."*  
> — **Thomas A. Edison**

> *"To all 33 student researchers across our 12 project groups: thank you for your relentless dedication, late-night debugging, intellectual curiosity, and collaborative excellence throughout Semester VI. The engineering rigor demonstrated in your physical models, control algorithms, and research blueprints stands as a testament to your professional growth and perseverance."*

## The Devil's Advocate: Cohort Reality Checks (Theoretical Roasts)

To shatter "simulation myopia" and prepare student engineering teams for relentless real-world operational challenges, every project incorporates an academic reality check exposing the divide between clean physics simulations and messy physical realities:

| **Group 04** | [Group_04_Rishi_Nicholas_Jai](./Group_04_Rishi_Nicholas_Jai) | LEO Space Debris Impedance Gripper | *Modeling viscoelastic impedance contact control in microgravity, where your biggest mathematical triumph will be transferring just enough rotational impulse during capture to convert a dead 2-ton Soviet booster into an unstoppable 10,000 RPM orbital buzzsaw.* |
| **Group 05** | [Group_05_Muaaz_Aditya_Zaid_Soumya](./Group_05_Muaaz_Aditya_Zaid_Soumya) | Cooperative Dual-UAV Campus Patrol | *Architecting a cooperative multi-agent aerial consensus protocol to detect campus perimeter breaches, completely ignoring that 15-knot coastal sea breezes, campus WiFi dead zones, and a flock of territorial pigeons will immediately turn your decentralized swarm consensus into a synchronized double-tree landing.* |

| **Group 11** | [Group_11_Daneeka](./Group_11_Daneeka) | Solar PV Defect Anomaly Detection AMR | *Simulating an autonomous ground rover with multimodal sensor arrays to inspect vast photovoltaic farms, naively assuming that high-intensity ground heat shimmer won't blind your thermal camera, blowing sand won't jam your steering linkages, and desert dust won't bake onto your solar panels faster than you can detect it.* |

## Pedagogical Architecture & Quality Framework

The curriculum combines the **Aalborg-UNESCO Problem-Based Learning (PBL)** model with the **Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO)** engineering syllabus:

1. **Rigorous Physics Modeling:** Every student team develops a complete DeepMind MuJoCo XML rigid-body model featuring accurate mass distributions, inertia tensors, joint friction/damping, collision geometries, and actuator limits.
2. **Closed-Loop Control & Telemetry:** Python control scripts implement closed-loop kinematics, trajectory generation, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and continuous 500 Hz CSV telemetry logging across at least $N \ge 50$ randomized Monte Carlo trials.
3. **Computer Science & Business Systems (CSBS) Technoeconomic Rigor:** All economic evaluations strictly exclude fiat currency denominations and express commercial feasibility through dimensionless **Operational Cost Parity Ratios ($\kappa \le 0.25$)**, payback horizons in operating months, and labor reallocation metrics.
4. **Foundational Literature Synthesis:** Every group maintains a verified literature portfolio of 6 authentic peer-reviewed papers (IEEE, ACM, Springer, Elsevier) with 100% active, verified CrossRef DOIs.

# 3. Work exclusively inside your designated group directory
cd Group_XX_<Your_Names>

# 4. Verify your local environment
python src/test_env.py

# 5. Stage and commit using Conventional Commits standard
git add .
git commit -m "feat(group-XX): implement closed-loop obstacle avoidance controller"
